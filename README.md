# Personal CRM
This web app is a personal crm where you can manage your customers. You can add new customers, edit and delete them (CRUD). Additionally, you can send your customers email directly from the app.
# Motivation
The motivation from this project stems from codecommentor.io. I like to make various projects when i am not at work to sharpen my web development skills and also for beginners to learn from.
